<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract">
<p>Television is often seen as a site for subcultural identification and subversive fantasy, including in queer cultures. How might we measure subversion, or the degree to which the depiction of social relationship between a dyad (e.g. two characters who are colleagues) deviates from its typical representation on TV? To explore this question, we introduce the task of stereotypic relationship extraction. Built on cognitive stylistics, linguistic anthropology, and dialogue relation extraction, in this paper, we attempt to model the cognitive process of stereotyping TV characters in dialogic interactions: given a dyad, we want to predict: what social relationship do the speakers exhibit through their words? Subversion is then characterized by the discrepancy between the distribution of the model's predictions and the ground truth labels. To demonstrate the usefulness of this task and gesture at a methodological intervention, we enclose four case studies to characterize the representation of queer relationalities in the  Big Bang Theory,  Frasier, and  Gilmore Girls  as we explore the suspicious and reparative modes of reading with our computational methods.</p>
