<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract">
<p>The still life genre is a good example of how even the simplest elements depicted in an artwork can be carriers of deeper, symbolic meanings that influence the overall artistic interpretation of it. In this paper, we present an ongoing study on the use of linked open data (LOD) to quantitatively analyze the symbolic meanings of still life paintings. In particular, we propose two different experiments based on (i) the theory of the art historian Bergström, and (ii) the impact of the Floriography movement in still life. To do so, we extract and combine data from Wikidata, HyperReal, IICONGRAPH, and the ODOR dataset. This work shows promising results about the use of LOD for art-historical quantitative research, as we are able to confirm Bergström's theory and to pinpoint outliers in the Floriography context that can be the objects of specific, qualitative studies. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the current limitations surrounding art-historical data.</p>
