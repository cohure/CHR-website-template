<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract">
<p>This research examines the Carthusian monastery of Herne, a major cultural hotspot during the Middle Ages. Between 1350 and 1400, the monks residing in Herne produced an impressive 46 production units, with 40 of them written in the Middle Dutch vernacular. Focusing on the monastery's most productive scribe, known as the Speculum Scribe, this case study employs methods from the field of scribal modelling to achieve two main objectives: first, to evaluate the potential for chronologically ordering the Speculum Scribe’s works based on his use of abbreviations, and second, to investigate whether there was a convergence in scribal practices, such as the use of abbreviations, among the scribes living in Herne. Although a complete chronological order of the Speculum Scribe's works could not be determined, we were able to establish his first work. Furthermore, the findings show evidence that cautiously supports the second goal, suggesting that the scribes in Herne indeed converged in their scribal habits by learning from each other.</p>
