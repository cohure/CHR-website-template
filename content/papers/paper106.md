<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract">
<p>Recent work on the textual features linked to literary quality has primarily focused on commercially published literature, such as canonical or best-selling novels, that are systematically filtered by editorial and market mechanisms. However, the biggest repositories of fiction texts currently in existence are free fanfiction websites, where fans post fictional stories about their favorite characters for the pleasure of writing and engaging with others. This makes them a particularly interesting domain to study the patterns of perceived quality ``in the wild'', where text-reader relations are less filtered.  Moreover, since fanfiction is a community-built domain with its own conventions, comparing it to published literature can more generally provide insights into the reception and perceived quality of published literature itself. Taking a novel approach to the study of fanfiction, we observe whether three textual features associated with perceived literary quality in published texts are also relevant in the context of fanfiction. Using different reception proxies, we find that despite the differences of fanfiction from published literature, some ``patterns of quality'' associated with positive reception appear to hold similar effects in both of these contexts of literary production.</p>
