<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract">
<p>This paper examines the relationship between violent discourse and emotional intensity in the early revolutionary rhetoric of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Using two fine-tuned  bert-base-chinese  models—one for detecting violent content in texts and another for assessing their affective charge—we analyze over 185,000 articles published between 1956 and 1989 in the  People's Liberation Army Daily ( Jiefangjun Bao ), the official journal of China's armed forces. We find a statistically significant correlation between violent discourse and emotional expression throughout the analyzed period. This strong alignment between violence and affect in official texts provides a valuable context for appreciating how other forms of writing, such as novels and poetry, can disentangle personal emotions from state power.</p>
