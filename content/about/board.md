title: "The Board"
---

CHR2024 served as the decor for the launch of the Society of Computational Humanities Research (SCHR). We have established a comprehensive board structure with dedicated officers:

<ul style="font-size:1.3rem;">
<li>Melvin Wevers (President)</li>
<li>Folgert Karsdorp (Vice-President)</li>
<li>Alie Lassche (Social Media & Event Officer)</li>
<li>Barbara McGillivray (Diversity and Inclusion Officer)</li>
<li>Kristoffer Nielbo (Journal Liaison)</li>
</ul>

Together with our robust diversity and inclusion guidelines, this structure ensures our community remains open, welcoming, and representative of all its members. More about the society and its role, as well as on vacant positions in the board, will follow shortly.
