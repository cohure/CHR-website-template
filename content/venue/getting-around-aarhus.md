In Aarhus, we say that everything is within walking distance and when you arrive to the city, it is obvious to see why. 
If you arrive at the train station, it is only a few minutes’ walk before arriving at your hotel or conference venue. 
From here, within minutes, you have the opportunity to experience a vibrant city life with restaurants, shopping, museums and cultural experiences - just waiting for you to explore.

      <summary><strong>Cycling</strong></summary>

Denmark is an ideal country for cycling. There are not many (very) steep hills and there are many safe cycling paths. 
Urban conditions for cyclists are one of the best in the world and constantly being improved. 
Look out for the special cyclists’ routes (cykelruter) and cycle paths (cykelstier). See [how to rent a bike](https://www.visitaarhus.com/areas-and-cities/aarhus/activities/aarhus-bike).
