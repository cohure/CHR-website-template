In Aarhus, we say that everything is within walking distance and when you arrive to the city, it is obvious to see why. 
If you arrive at the train station, it is only a few minutes walk before arriving at your hotel or conference venue. 
From here, within minutes, you have the opportunity to experience a vibrant city life with restaurants, shopping, museums and cultural experiences - just waiting for you to explore. The many ways you can travel around Aarhus are listed below.

<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Walking</h3>

The entire city is clean, compact and well-organised, which makes walking an excellent and enjoyable way to get around.
To walk from the centre of the city to the university takes approximately 30 minutes.



<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Taxi/Cab</h3>

To book a taxi, please call (+45) 8948 4848 or ask your hotel receptionist. There is also a taxi stand right outside the main exit of the train station and conveniently located taxi stands all over the city.


<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Bus</h3>

Aarhus Sporveje, the municipal bus company, runs the yellow buses in the city. The bus route number is indicated at the front and the back of the bus and the destination is displayed at the front and above the rear door.  

*Please note* that you cannot buy tickets on the bus or light rail. For more information on how to buy a ticket before travelling, please check your options [here](https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/ticket-bus-and-light-rail-aarhus-region-gdk720815).


<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Letbanen (Light rail)</h3>

Getting around in Aarhus is also easy with Denmark’s first light rail, Letbanen, operated by the company Midttrafik. Stops are located throughout Aarhus, making it easy to experience the city. The area around the Central Station and Dokk1 is the main junction point.

*Please note* that you cannot buy tickets on the bus or light rail.

<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Cycling</h3>

Denmark is an ideal country for cycling. There are not many (very) steep hills and there are many safe cycling paths. 
Urban conditions for cyclists are one of the best in the world and constantly being improved. 
Look out for the special cyclists’ routes (cykelruter) and cycle paths (cykelstier). [Read more about how to rent a bike](https://www.visitaarhus.com/areas-and-cities/aarhus/activities/aarhus-bike).
