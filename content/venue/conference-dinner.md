Join us for the conference dinner on December 5th at **Restaurant Havnær**, a name that translates to "close to the ocean" in Danish. Nestled at the edge of Aarhus Ø, this beautiful venue offers breathtaking views over Aarhus Bay, creating the perfect setting for a memorable evening.

Their approach reflects the charm of Jutland, meeting guests at eye level and offering a relaxed atmosphere where you can simply sit back, enjoy the moment, and take in the stunning surroundings from the SHIP building.
