        <p>In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and
mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This
research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction
of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical
approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing
and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these
approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area,
many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to
present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of
traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities. This is the
scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More precisely, the
conference aims at</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions
relying on a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to
humanities data in all its forms. We consider this community to be
complementary to the digital humanities landscape. We actively seek,
welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and
identities to join. This includes, but is not limited to, scholars from underrepresented groups, different academic paths, and those who are contributing novel perspectives to the computational humanities landscape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting good practices through sharing “research stories”. Such good
practices may include, for instance, the publication of code and data in
order to support transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering
research design to present theoretical justification, hypotheses, and
proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign of the reviewing process for
interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational approaches to answer
questions relevant to the humanities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of interest</h3>
<p>We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including &ndash; but
not limited to &ndash; the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications of statistical methods and machine learning to process, enrich and analyse humanities data, including new media and cultural heritage data;</li>
<li>Hypothesis-driven humanities research, simulations and generative models;</li>
<li>Development of new quantitative and empirical methods for humanities research;</li>
<li>Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities;</li>
<li>Evaluation methods, evaluation data sets and development of standards;</li>
<li>Formal, statistical or quantitative  evaluation of categorization / periodization;</li>
<li>Theoretical frameworks and epistemology for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;</li>
<li>Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;</li>
<li>Visualisation, dissemination (incl. Open science) and teaching in computational humanities.</li>
<li>Potential and challenges of AI applications to humanities research.</li>
</ul>
<p>To gain further insight into paper topics, please also refer to the proceedings of previous years: <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/">CHR2020</a>,
<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2989/">CHR2021</a>, <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/">CHR2022</a>, <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/">CHR2023</a>.</p>
<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>
<p>The 2024 edition of the Computational Humanities Research conference will be hosted by the <a href="https://dighumlab.org/">DIGHUMLAB</a> and
<a href="https://chc.au.dk/">Center for Humanities Computing, Aarhus University</a>.
The conference will be a hybrid event with an option to attend in person in Aarhus, virtually, or a combination
of the two. More details will follow soon.</p>

<h3 id="submission-types">Submission types</h3>
<p><strong>Long Papers</strong>: up to <strong>5000</strong> words (ca. 10 pages, references, abstract and
tables/illustrations excluded). Long papers report on completed, original and
unpublished results. Brevity of argument is preferred. We welcome the use of
appendices or other supplementary information.</p>
<p><strong>Short Papers</strong>: up to <strong>3000</strong> words (ca. 6 pages, references, abstract and
tables/illustrations excluded). Short papers report on focused
contributions, and may present work in progress. Short papers are presented
either as short oral presentations or posters. We welcome the use of
appendices or other supplementary information.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Talks</strong>: Submit an abstract of up to 750 words (excluding references,
tables and illustrations) to give a 5 minute presentation
during a lightning talks session. This format can be well suited for reporting
work in progress, introducing ideas, preliminary results, or focused
question-answer research.</p>
<p><strong>Workshops</strong>: up to <strong>1500</strong> words. Workshops should be organised to be more
interactive than the main conference. The workshops will take place before the
conference, on 3 December. Workshop proposals should describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>the aims and set up of the workshop,</li>
<li>the academic background for the work,</li>
<li>proposed length (e.g. half day or full day),</li>
<li>an outline of the day, including the types of activities,</li>
<li>the expected key outcomes,</li>
<li>a short bio of each organiser or presenter, including their name, affiliation, email address</li>
<li>a plan for promoting the workshop to draw participants.</li>
<li>specific requirements, including but not limited to special equipment (e.g. audio/video), software, physical space arrangements,</li>
<li>any technical knowledge, skills, or experience participants should have prior to attending the workshop.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-instructions-and-review-process">Submission instructions and review process</h3>
<p>We welcome submissions from scholars of diverse backgrounds and particularly from under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Submissions should be written in English and must be formatted according to the

<p>An initial paper submission must be submitted to EasyChair by July 11.
No new submissions will be accepted after this deadline.
Existing submissions can be <em>updated</em> until the final submission deadline of July 15.
While earlier versions of submission may be used to determine reviewer assignments,
only the final submission will be used within the review process itself.</p>
