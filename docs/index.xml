      <description>Purpose of the Code of Conduct The organisers of the Computational Humanities Research conference are committed to providing a safe and inclusive space, with respectful and equitable treatment for everyone. This code is meant to guide speakers, session chairs, organisers, attendees, and people who might be involved with the conference in other ways. It was inspired by the code of conduct of the BRIDGES 2022 conference published in bridges2022.com/code-of-conduct.&#xA;Approach and principles This code draws on an intersectional perspective, considering the interlocking character of various dimensions such as gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, age, disability, and religion/creed as axes of discrimination.</description>

      <description>We cordially invite you and other interested parties to join the Computational Humanities Research forum! The forum serves as an asynchronous platform to discuss all ideas and questions related to computational humanities research. These can be in-depth discussions about fundamental topics and questions of the discipline, or very practical ones, for example about how best to tackle a certain technical (coding) problem. And everything in between. Come join!</description>

      <description>Extended initial submission deadline: July 11, 2024 AoE (23:59:59 UTC-12) Deadline for updating existing submissions: July 15, 2024 AoE (23:59:59 UTC-12) In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these approaches.</description>
