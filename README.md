# CHR website

Template website for the Computational Humanities Research conference. The
website is built on top of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. Below are
some pointers to get you started with the website. 

1. Replace the placeholders [YEAR], [DATE], [NUMBER] and [LOCATION] in all files.
2. To compile the site, run `hugo` in the top directory. The compiled version of the
   website can be found in `./docs`, which is the folder served by GitHub;
3. All content is written in markdown and can be found in the folder `./content`;
4. All elements related to the theme can be found in `./themes/chr`.
5. `draft: true` makes sure a webpage is not published.
